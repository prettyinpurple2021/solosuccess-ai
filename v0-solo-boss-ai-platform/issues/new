### Title: Fix Docker Build Failure by Installing DevDependencies Needed for Next.js + Tailwind

## Problem

The Docker build is failing with the error:

```
Error: Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'
Build failed because of webpack errors
```

This is caused by the build phase only installing production dependencies (`npm ci --only=production`), which omits devDependencies such as `tailwindcss`. Since Next.js requires Tailwind (and possibly other devDependencies) during the build, the build fails.

## Affected Files

- [Dockerfile](https://github.com/prettyinpurple2021/v0-solo-boss-ai-platform/blob/09c430b3b2876143c021730e6e66fe0fc1148b41/Dockerfile)
- [package.json](https://github.com/prettyinpurple2021/v0-solo-boss-ai-platform/blob/09c430b3b2876143c021730e6e66fe0fc1148b41/package.json)

## Solution

1. **Update the Dockerfile** so that all dependencies, including devDependencies, are installed during the build phase.
2. This means removing `--only=production` from the `npm ci` command in the build stage.

### Before (current Dockerfile snippet):

```dockerfile
FROM base AS deps
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --legacy-peer-deps --only=production
```

### After (proposed fix):

```dockerfile
FROM base AS deps
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
```

> This ensures that `tailwindcss` and other devDependencies are available for the Next.js build.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Docker build completes successfully in CI/CD.
- [ ] No "Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'" or similar errors during the build.
- [ ] Next.js build output is present in the final image.
