### Steps to Investigate
1. Review the job log for specific error messages.
2. Check for missing or incorrect require/import statements in the codebase.
3. Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed in `package.json`.
4. Run `npm install` locally and verify all modules load without errors.
5. Ensure module paths/names are correct and match the case sensitivity.
