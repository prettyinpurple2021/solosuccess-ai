# SoloSuccess AI – Project Standards

- Production quality only: no mocks, placeholders, disabled code, demos, or TODO comments.
- Follow the audit truth source: see [COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT.md](mdc:COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT.md). Update this file when fixing issues.
- Enforce the Cyberpunk Design System v3 across all UI: see [DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](mdc:DESIGN_SYSTEM.md).
- Keep code maintainable: typed APIs, early returns, clear naming, minimal nesting, meaningful errors.
- Zero console noise: prefer project logger and structured errors over `console.*`.
- Never commit broken builds, lint errors, or warnings.
