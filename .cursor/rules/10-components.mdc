# Components Guidelines

- Styling: Use Tailwind classes; do not use inline styles. Extract repeated styles into utilities.
- Animations: Use CSS animations for smooth transitions and effects.
- Design: Follow [DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](mdc:DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) utilities and components for branding and consistency.
- Accessibility: Provide `aria-*` labels where needed; ensure inputs have labels; support reduced motion.
- No placeholders: Remove demo, mock, or commented-out code. Do not merge incomplete features.
