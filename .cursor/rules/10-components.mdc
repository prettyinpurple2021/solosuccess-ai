description: Components must use Tailwind for styling and Framer Motion for animations where applicable
---
# Components Guidelines

- Styling: Use Tailwind classes; do not use inline styles. Extract repeated styles into utilities.
- Animations: Use Framer Motion components/APIs for motion and transitions when animation is needed.
- Design: Follow [HOLOGRAPHIC_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](mdc:HOLOGRAPHIC_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) utilities and components (e.g., HolographicCard, HolographicButton).
- Accessibility: Provide `aria-*` labels where needed; ensure inputs have labels; support reduced motion.
- No placeholders: Remove demo, mock, or commented-out code. Do not merge incomplete features.
