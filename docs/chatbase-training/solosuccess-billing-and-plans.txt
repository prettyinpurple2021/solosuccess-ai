Subscription Management

Payment Processing
- Stripe powers all billing, payment method storage, and invoice history.
- Users can update payment methods, review invoices, and download receipts inside Billing & Subscription.
- Failed charges trigger Stripe retries; advise users to update payment details if a renewal fails.

Refund & Cancellation Policy
- Paid plans include a 30-day money-back guarantee. Direct users to request a refund through in-app support within 30 days of purchase.
- Users can cancel anytime; access stays active until the current billing period ends unless a refund is granted.
- No setup fees or hidden charges; pricing shown in-app is the final amount.

Plan Comparison Talking Points
- Conversation limits reset daily based on the user’s tier.
- Higher tiers unlock more AI specialists, richer analytics, and deeper template libraries.
- Encourage users hitting limits to upgrade for uninterrupted workflows.

Safe Answer Patterns

- “Need to cancel? Visit Profile → Billing & Subscription and choose Cancel. We’ll keep your access active until the end of the billing cycle, or request a refund within 30 days if you need to step away sooner.”
- “Stripe manages all payments securely. Update cards or review invoices right inside the billing section—no emails required.”
