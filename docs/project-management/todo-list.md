## 💅 Girlboaa Boss-Level Improvements (Actionable, In Order)

1) Templates DELETE API — make the trash button lethal (and safe)

- [x] Create `app/api/templates/[id]/route.ts` with `DELETE`
  - [x] Require auth via `authenticateRequest()` and 401 on missing
  - [x] Verify ownership: `DELETE FROM user_templates WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2`
  - [x] Return 404 if not found/not owned, 204 on success
- [x] Update `components/templates/saved-templates-list.tsx` to optimistically remove
- [x] Add a test to ensure non-owners can’t delete

2) Templates Export — let the boss download her brilliance

- [x] In `SavedTemplatesList`, implement client-side JSON export for each template
  - [x] Filename: `${template.template_slug}-${template.id}.json`
  - [x] Use `URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([json], { type: 'application/json' }))` + hidden link click

3) Centralize shared types — one source of truth, zero drama

- [x] Add `lib/types.ts` and export: `SavedTemplate`
- [ ] Add `UserProfile`, `SubscriptionStatus`, etc.
- [x] Replace duplicate interfaces for templates in hooks/components

4) Zod validation on every API — no messy inputs in this house

- [x] Add `zod` and create schemas for:
  - [x] `POST /api/auth/signin` and `POST /api/auth/signup`
  - [x] `GET/POST /api/templates` and `DELETE /api/templates/[id]`
  - [x] `PATCH /api/profile` and `POST /api/tasks/bulk-update`
- [x] Validate `request.json()` and return typed, consistent errors/responses

5) Auth flow consistency — same glam, every route

- [x] Standardize user retrieval with a single helper (use `lib/auth-server.ts`)
- [x] Ensure JWT cookie options are consistent across sign-in/sign-out
- [x] Add `/api/auth/logout` to clear the cookie cleanly

6) Rate limiting + Idempotency — unshakeable under pressure

- [x] Create `lib/rate-limit.ts` utility and use it in `signin`, `signup`, `chat`
- [x] Implement idempotency keys for write endpoints and webhooks
  - [x] Add Neon table: `idempotency_keys(key text primary key, created_at timestamptz default now())`
  - [x] Respect `Idempotency-Key` header and skip duplicates

7) Database indexes + updated_at triggers — faster, fresher, fiercer

- [x] Add index: `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_templates_user_created ON user_templates(user_id, created_at)`
- [x] Verify `updated_at` triggers on all tables (align with `docs/migrations/005-*`)
- [x] Add SQL migration and run via `scripts/run-user-templates-index-migration.mjs`

8) Observability — see everything, fix anything

- [x] Add Sentry (`@sentry/nextjs`) setup (client + server)
- [x] Use structured logs in API routes with context (user_id, route, status)
- [x] Keep `/api/health` as liveness; add `/api/health/deps` for dependency checks
- [x] Create proper Next.js instrumentation files for Sentry

9) Data fetching & cache — silky smooth UX

- [x] Introduce SWR for `/api/templates` and `/api/profile`
- [x] Hook `useTemplateSave()` into SWR (mutate after save/delete)

10) Edge-friendly reads — speed where it sparkles

- [x] Mark read-only list endpoints with `export const runtime = 'edge'` where compatible (e.g., `GET /api/templates`)
- [x] Keep writes (POST/DELETE) on Node runtime
- [x] Disable Edge runtime for routes that use jsonwebtoken (not Edge compatible)

11) Accessibility & QA — inclusive and bulletproof

- [x] Sweep critical components for labels/aria/contrast
- [x] Add Playwright smoke tests for:
  - [x] Sign in
  - [x] Templates list load/export/delete
  - [x] Update profile (avatar + name)

12) CI/CD gates — only fab commits make it to main

- [x] Add GitHub Actions workflow: install, typecheck, lint, test, build on PR
- [x] Require green checks before merge

13) Testing strategy — receipts or it didn’t happen

- [x] Add `jest` for API unit tests
- [x] Unit tests for Zod schemas and API handler happy/edge paths
- [x] Playwright E2E covering auth → templates → profile

14) Webhook glow-up — Chargebee, but make it safe

- [x] Verify Chargebee webhook signatures using signing secret
- [x] Store and enforce idempotency for events
- [ ] Reconcile subscription states with feature gates used in UI

15) Privacy controls — user data, user rules

- [ ] Add `GET /api/account/export` to deliver a full JSON export of user data
- [ ] Add `DELETE /api/account/delete` to purge user data across tables (with auth + confirmation safeguards)
- [ ] Update GDPR pages to link to these endpoints
