# WooCommerce Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you connect your WooCommerce store to SoloSuccess AI for revenue tracking.

## Overview

SoloSuccess AI uses WooCommerce REST API to securely access your store's sales data. This enables you to:

- ✅ Track revenue from WooCommerce sales
- ✅ Monitor order activity
- ✅ Analyze revenue trends
- ✅ View sales history

**Your WooCommerce data remains private** - SoloSuccess AI only accesses it with your explicit permission.

---

## Prerequisites

- ✅ WordPress site with WooCommerce installed
- ✅ Admin access to your WordPress site
- ✅ SoloSuccess AI account

---

## Step 1: Generate WooCommerce API Keys

### 1.1 Access WooCommerce Settings

1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard
2. Navigate to **WooCommerce → Settings**
3. Click on the **"Advanced"** tab
4. Click on **"REST API"** in the left sidebar

### 1.2 Create a New API Key

1. Click **"Add key"** button
2. Fill in the key details:
   - **Description**: `SoloSuccess AI Revenue Tracking` (or any name you prefer)
   - **User**: Select your admin user account
   - **Permissions**: Select **"Read"** (read-only access)
3. Click **"Generate API key"**

### 1.3 Copy Your API Credentials

After generating the key, you'll see:

1. **Consumer Key** - Copy this value (looks like: `ck_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
2. **Consumer Secret** - Copy this value (looks like: `cs_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

**⚠️ Important:** 
- Keep these credentials secure. Never share them publicly.
- You can only see the Consumer Secret once. Save it immediately.

### 1.4 Get Your Store URL

1. Note your WordPress site URL (e.g., `https://yourstore.com`)
2. The WooCommerce REST API endpoint will be: `https://yourstore.com/wp-json/wc/v3`

## Step 2: Verify API Access

### 2.1 Test API Connection

You can test your API credentials using curl or a tool like Postman:

```bash
curl https://yourstore.com/wp-json/wc/v3/orders \
  -u ck_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:cs_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

If successful, you should see a JSON response with your orders.
