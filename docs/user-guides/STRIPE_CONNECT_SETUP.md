# Stripe Connect Setup Guide

This guide will help you connect your own Stripe account to SoloSuccess AI for revenue tracking and analytics.

## Overview

SoloSuccess AI uses **Stripe Connect** to allow you to connect **your own Stripe account** securely. This enables you to:

- ✅ Track **your own** revenue and MRR
- ✅ Monitor **your own** subscription metrics
- ✅ Analyze **your own** payment data
- ✅ View **your own** financial analytics

**Your Stripe data remains private** - SoloSuccess AI only accesses it with your explicit permission.

## Step 1: Set Up Stripe Connect (Platform Setup)

**Note:** This is a one-time setup that your SoloSuccess AI administrator needs to complete. If you're the platform owner, follow these steps:

### 1.1 Create a Stripe Platform Account

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. If you don't have a Stripe account, create one
3. Navigate to **Settings → Connect** (or go to [Stripe Connect](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/applications/overview))

### 1.2 Enable Stripe Connect

1. Click **"Get started"** or **"Enable Connect"**
2. Choose **"Express accounts"** (recommended) or **"Standard accounts"**
   - Express: Faster onboarding, Stripe handles most of the UI
   - Standard: More control, you handle more of the UI
3. Complete the Connect onboarding

### 1.3 Get Your Client ID

1. In **Settings → Connect**, find your **Client ID**
2. It looks like: `ca_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
3. Copy this value - you'll need it for the environment variable

### 1.4 Configure Redirect URI

1. In **Settings → Connect → Redirects**, add:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/api/integrations/stripe/connect/callback
   ```
   (Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain)

### 1.5 Set Environment Variables

Your SoloSuccess AI administrator needs to add these to `.env.local`:

```bash
# Stripe Connect Configuration
STRIPE_CONNECT_CLIENT_ID=ca_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  # Your platform's secret key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  # Optional: for webhooks
```

## Step 2: Connect Your Stripe Account (User Setup)

Once Stripe Connect is configured on the platform, you can connect your own Stripe account:

### 2.1 Go to Settings

1. Log in to SoloSuccess AI
2. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Revenue Tracking**
3. Click **"Connect Stripe Account"**

### 2.2 Authorize Connection

1. You'll be redirected to Stripe's authorization page
2. **Sign in to your Stripe account** (or create one if you don't have it)
3. Review the permissions being requested:
   - **Read access** to your account information
   - **Read access** to charges, subscriptions, and payment data
   - **Write access** (optional, for creating subscriptions if needed)
4. Click **"Connect my Stripe account"**

### 2.3 Complete Connection

1. You'll be redirected back to SoloSuccess AI
2. Your Stripe account will be connected
3. Revenue data will start syncing automatically
