# PayPal Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you connect your PayPal Business account to SoloSuccess AI for revenue tracking.

## Overview

SoloSuccess AI uses PayPal's REST API to securely access your transaction data. This enables you to:

- ✅ Track revenue from PayPal transactions
- ✅ Monitor payment activity
- ✅ Analyze revenue trends
- ✅ View transaction history

**Your PayPal data remains private** - SoloSuccess AI only accesses it with your explicit permission.

- ✅ Access to PayPal Developer Dashboard
- ✅ SoloSuccess AI account
