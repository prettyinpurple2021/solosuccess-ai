## Problem
Cloud Run deployment is failing due to the use of an unsupported field: `initialDelaySeconds` in the `readinessProbe` section of `cloudrun.yaml`. Cloud Run does **not** support `initialDelaySeconds` for readiness probes, which results in this error:

```
ERROR: (gcloud.run.services.replace) service.spec.template.spec.containers[0].readiness_probe: Initial delay is not supported for readiness probe.
```

See failing job: https://github.com/prettyinpurple2021/v0-solo-boss-ai-platform/actions/runs/17196623191/job/48779613721 (ref: cb934b30b86e41f5cc9107405ae7b59b40926885)

## Solution
1. Open `cloudrun.yaml`.
2. Locate the `readinessProbe` configuration under containers.
3. Remove the `initialDelaySeconds` (or similar) field from the `readinessProbe` section.
4. Save and commit the changes.
5. Push to the repository and re-run the deployment workflow.
