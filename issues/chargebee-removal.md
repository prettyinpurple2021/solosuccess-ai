Chargebee should not be part of this project anymore, as it is no longer being used. The failing job includes errors related to missing Chargebee webhook modules, which should be removed along with any related code, dependencies, test files, and configuration references. Additionally, resolve remaining test failures by ensuring all module paths are correct in tsconfig.json and jest.config.js, and validate that error-handling tests (such as for ScrapingScheduler) assert expected behavior. For complete resolution: (1) remove all Chargebee-related code and references, (2) update configuration to fix module resolution errors, and (3) confirm tests correctly handle all expected errors.
